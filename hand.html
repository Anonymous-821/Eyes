                You know what this huge admiration towards you made me? Complete. 
                <br>This huge admiration, this level of adore..they just make me complete. 
                <br>You taught me to love, love. 🥰😘
                <br>You taught me to love the way I loved..
                <br>You taught me to love the way I was loved...
                <br>You taught me to love to leave the erosions in my life 
                <br>And you taught me to love to embrace the eternal balance of my life❤️‍🩹💖❤️😇
                <br>
                I am, at times, struck with the thought that what of I haven't texted you at all, or what if we haven't talked at all...
                I then realised I wouldn't have been in here, the place which is the core reason for my arrogance, my self respect and the fruit of my talent... The realisation of my capabilities 🥺🥺
               <br>It's often portrayed that I guided you, I taught you and I took you through hardships by your hand, love..
                <br>But the truth is it was your who pulled me over all my predicaments and guided me...
                It was you who took my hand and never left it🤜🏻🤛🏻❤️🫂😭😭
