            Hello beauty! 
            </br>I must have said a million times that I love you, Abhiii..here's how much ...
            I don't love you, instead all the love that remains in me, is you yourself....
            You are the love Abhiiii💗💗🫂
            </br>have seen myself in wrath, with a strong head, and tall ego....
            </br>I have heard myself giving cusses, speaking sharp words, and whispering pessimism...
            </br>I have sensed myself in tears of someone else's agony...
            </br>For the world, my pride comes before anything...but you mean all the world to me so love, my pride kneels before you🥹❤️
        </p>

        <p class="next text">
            Even babies nowadays, who actually are still putting their fingers in their mouths say "You are my everything"... Hey love, listen now...
            </br>if I listen to nobody when I am triggered, then you are my nobody 💖
            </br>If I care about nothing, then you are my nothing 💖
            </br>And if all the soft side status of mine is none, then you are the void space that is filled in me 💖
            </br>Similarly, if nobody has a right to tease you, then I am your nobody 😂💖 
            </br>if nothing has an ability to put you on your regular high, then I am your nothing 😚💖
            </br>If nothing also means something, precisely everything, then it would you and me I presume😌💫✨
